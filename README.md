This contains the code used to generate the graphs and video frames from the poster as well as the entire video and the data used to produce it.

The data was generated using direct numerical simulation code written in the open-source Basilisk software and is a modified version of the computational framework used for the Alventosa, Cimpeanu and Harris publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (2023).
