# Droplet Bounces


This contains the code used to generate the graphs and video frames from the poster as well as the entire video and the data used to produce it. You can also find the academic and public versions of the posters in the files section.

The data was generated using direct numerical simulation code written in the open-source [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) software and is a modified version of [the computational framework](https://github.com/rcsc-group/BouncingDroplets) used for the Alventosa, Cimpeanu and Harris [publication](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/inertiocapillary-rebound-of-a-droplet-impacting-a-fluid-bath/93C2414D27C42F17BF67587E9C5BA6AF) in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (2023).


The video is also here. We see that over time, the model and DNS become further apart, which will be due to propagation of errors caused by the simplifications and approximations made. We do see good agreement throughout the initial bounce though, which is the most important part.
