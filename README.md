# Droplet Bounces
---
This contains the code used to generate the graphs and video frames from the poster as well as the entire video and the data used to produce it.

The data was generated using direct numerical simulation code written in the open-source [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) software and is a modified version of [the computational framework](https://github.com/rcsc-group/BouncingDroplets) used for the Alventosa, Cimpeanu and Harris [publication](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/inertiocapillary-rebound-of-a-droplet-impacting-a-fluid-bath/93C2414D27C42F17BF67587E9C5BA6AF) in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics (2023).
